# Code24

Code24 is a programming project idea where a 2 person team completes small, fun
software projects in 24 work hours. 

## Why Code24

When many people get the itch to take on a programming project, they can get
overly ambitious. This leads to many failed and/or aborted projects because the 
programmer either doesn't have the time to complete the project or simply loses
interest.

Thus, Code24 allows programmers to avoid this common pitfall and actually
produce code and projects that they enjoy and inspire further involvement in the
open source world!

## Inspiration

The idea for Code24 is derived from the folks over at 
[Code 52](http://code52.org/) whom accomplish a new programming project every
week. While their schedule is quite impressive (not to mention aggressive), 
alot of people don't have time between work, family, and hobbies to keep up with
the Code52 folks. Thus, Code24 provides an alternate avenue for busy people to 
enjoy social coding!

## Goals

The goals for Code24 include:

* Learn how to work in a 2 person team to accomplish a project in 24 work hours
(2 people working 12 hours each)
* Learn the ins and outs of __social coding__
* Create your own open source projects
* Contribute to existing open source projects
* Learn, explore and play with new and exciting technologies (you know, the
stuff they don't let you use at work!)
* Give you material to blog about and teach others what you've learned
* Actually complete a project and share it with the world
* Have fun!

## How It Works

### 1. Pick a coding partner

A coworker, a friend, a random person on the internet. Helps if you share
interest in similar technologies (i.e. programming languages, frameworks, etc).

### 2. Brainstorm project ideas

Utilize email, video chat, wikis to brainstorm, collect and organize project
ideas. Remember to scope ideas so that it seems realistic to accomplish in 24
hours.

Discuss collected ideas and come to an agreement on a single idea. Don't waste
time arguging over which idea is better, as you can complete other ideas in the
future. Use the _fun_ factor as your main selection criteria.

### 3. Design your project

Now that your project idea has been selected, you should do some design. Once
again, utilize email, video chat, and wikis to help flesh out the idea. Create a
vision statement (if you're into that sort of thing), come up with some use
cases, and list some __fun__ features you want to implement.

This step is important as it will help your team focus your efforts and help you
get started quickly.

If you're not to big on design, you should read
[this article](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000036.html) about
why you should be designing. If you're just unfamiliar, then you should also read
[the second part](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000035.html).

Make sure you agree on the technologies you are going to use to accomplish the
project, such as programming language, version control, etc.

### 4. Start coding

Now that you've laid the foundation for your project, its time to get your hands
dirty!

Coordinating with your teammate, pick a date/time and a schedule to accomplish
the project. Some examples include:

* 12 hour marathon on a weekend
* 4, 3 hour sessions over the course of a week

Also, keep in mind that you can work on the entire project together in the same
room, or completely seperate. The choice is yours and yours alone!

### 5. Finish

Awesome, you __actually finished__ a project! And you had fun doing it, not to
mention you got to kick it with an old friend? 

Now select a frequency for accomplishing a Code24 project with your partner
(i.e. once a month, 6 times a year, etc) and go to Step 1.

And don't forget to blog about your project and the cool stuff you just learned!
